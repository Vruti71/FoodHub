              <h1>What is a food hub?</h1>

              <h3>A regional food hub is a business or organization that actively manages the aggregation, distribution, and marketing of source-identified food products 
                primarily from local and regional producers to strengthen their ability to satisfy wholesale, retail, and institutional demand.<br><br>
                <p>Food value chains represent an innovative business model in which agricultural producers, manufacturers, buyers, and other related supply chain actors 
                form collaborative, transparent partnerships that attempt to combine product differentiation strategies with commitment to shared operational values and social 
              mission goals.  Unlike traditional corporate marketing approaches, which focus on the superior attributes of a firm’s products or services, value chains address 
            customers’ desire to promote social improvement.</p></h3><br><br>
